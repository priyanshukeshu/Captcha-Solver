echo "# CleverC4PTCHA: Crack the Code!

## Overview
CleverC4PTCHA is a CAPTCHA extraction interface developed to accurately extract text from 4-letter CAPTCHAs using OpenCV and Keras. The project features a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of over 9,500 CAPTCHA images, achieving an impressive accuracy of 99.85%.

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Efficiently extracts text from 4-letter CAPTCHAs.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a CNN model trained on 9.5k+ images for high accuracy.
- **Image Processing Techniques**: Incorporates image thresholding and contour detection to enhance recognition capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Deployed on Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Live Demo
